This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

20. Vectors

vectors: the objects that underlie tibbles

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

There are two types of vectors:

Atomic vectors: 
six types: logical, integer, double, character, complex, raw and numeric (integer and double vectors) 
homogeneous

Lists (sometimes called recursive vectors when lists contain other lists)
heterogeneous

Vectors have two key properties: type (typeof()) and length (length())

Logical vectors are the simplest type of atomic vector because they can take only three possible values: FALSE, TRUE, and NA. You can create them by hand with c().

Numeric vectors, to make an integer, place an L after the number

Character vectors are the most complex type of atomic vector, because each element of a character vector is a string, and a string can contain an arbitrary amount of data.

Exersices: 

is.finite() considers missing varaibles to be finite whereas is.infinite() considers missing varaibles to be infinite.

```{r}
dplyr::near
```

The function parse_logical() parses logical values, the function parse_integer() parses integer values.

There are two ways to convert, or coerce, one type of vector to another:
Explicit coercion
Implicit coercion--this one is more common

Safest to use is_*insertvectortypehere to sort by type of vector

All types of vectors can be named. You can name them during creation with c():
```{r}
c(x = 1, y = 2, z = 4)
set_names(1:3, c("a", "b", "c"))
```


There are four types of things that you can subset a vector with:

A numeric vector containing only integers. The integers must either be all positive, all negative, or zero.
A logical vector which keeps all values corresponding to a TRUE value. 
A character vector if you have a preexisting named vector.
The simplest type of subsetting is nothing, x[], which returns the complete x.

Lists are a step up in complexity from atomic vectors, because lists can contain other lists. 

Function to make a list: list()
str() show structure of the lists 

Lists can contain multiple varaible types and other lists: 
```{r}
y <- list("a", 1L, 1.5, TRUE)
str(y)
```
```{r}
z <- list(list(1, 2), list(3, 4))
str(z)
```

Factors are designed to represent categorical data that can take a fixed set of possible values. They are built on top of integers, and have a levels attribute.

Dates in R are numeric vectors that represent the number of days since 1 January 1970.
```{r}
x <- as.Date("1971-01-01")
unclass(x)
```
This shows 365 days have passed since 1970-01-01
